The following procedure takes a few days to get through because of clearance delays, so please start straight away, since every thing else in the course depends on it :)

We will run parts of this course on a High Performance Computing cluster, HPC2N. The cluster is a local resource in Umeå, and to use it you need a user account both at the National Academic Infrastructure for Super­computing in Sweden (NAISS), and at HPC2N. 

## Create a user account at SUPR/NAISS

::: {.callout-important}
## To do for you
Fill out & submit the [account request form](https://supr.naiss.se/person/register/).
Read carefully and follow the provided instructions.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
- Use "Register with Federated Identity" if you are enrolled in a Swedish university.
- If you are not enrolled in a Swedish university or if the previous option doesn't work for you, use instead "Register without Federated Identity".

### Accept NAISS user agreement

Just after creating the SUPR account, on the page you are taken to, there will be a section titled “User Agreement” at the very top. Just under it is the button named “Accept NAISS User Agreement”. 

::: {.callout-important}
## To do for you
Click it.
:::

Alternately, if you do this at a later point. Login to SUPR. At the very top it will say “NAISS User Agreement Pending”.

::: {.callout-tip}
- Use `With SWAMID` if you are enrolled in a Swedish university - **this option is much faster!**
- If you are not enrolled in a Swedish university use instead `Alternative: Offline via Paper Form`. Here you will have to print out, sign and send in the form. **This may take up to a week. **
:::

When you have a SUPR account you can join our course project on HPC2N:
