What does that even mean?\n\n\nCheck the SAM file and check how many hits we have - use samtools to do so. Module load the tool, or get the appropriate container. Look into the samtools manual to figure out how to look at the file.\nNow you can play around a bit. You could see what influence the trimming might have on the mapping of these data. For that re-run the mapping with the trimmed data. Make sure you point towards the correct file paths!\nCheck the log and SAM file and see what difference we have.\nTime allowing, I propose to run a third test mapping either using the raw data of trimmed data by changing the mapping mode from local to end-to-end or from very-sensitive to fast, loosing some accuracy but reducing the mapping time.\nReplace in the commands above –very-sensitive-local to –very-sensitive or from –very-sensitive-local to –fast-local.\nAgain, compare the output with the previous ones."
