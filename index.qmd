# The data

The data we will be working on today are DNA sequencing data and RNA sequencing data from cassava cultivars.

The paired end DNA sequences were retreived from the cassava cultivar called [TMEB117](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/376387151_Haplotype-resolved_genome_of_heterozygous_African_cassava_cultivar_TMEB117_Manihot_esculenta), a strain that whose genome is now known and that, due to its susceptibility to certain cassava diseases, can be used as a reference for studying virus resistance mechanisms in cassava.

The paired end RNA sequencing data comes from a cassava genotype called [TMEB419](https://www.agrobiotech.bio/en/cassava/57-manioc.html). This cultivar was bred to be highly resistant to various cassava viruses and is used commercially. 

Special thanks to Andreas Gisel for providing these samples (and the picture above)!
